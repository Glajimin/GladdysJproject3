    "In this project I am looking at how blocking a gene called *Smad3* changes gene expression patterns related to fat accumulation and metabolism in mice. I am using an RNA expression data set from mouse liver tissue to connect specific genes to hepatic steatosis (fatty liver) and high-fat diet. My goal is to explore the data set and understand its structure. Additionaly, I want to make some basic summaries and visualizations that relate back to the hypotheses from the paper."

    "\n",
    "i. In this experiment scientists measured the activity of specific anti-inflammatory genes in the fat tissue of mice to see how a high-fat diet and the absence of the Smad3 gene would affect them. The groups tested were wild-type mice which have the Smad3 gene active and Smad3 knockout mice that don’t have this gene active. Each mouse was fed either a regular diet or a high-fat diet. The figure shows gene expression for the genes Il10, Chi3l3, Arg1, Mrc2, Mgl2, and Mgl1. The Y-axis represents how much the expression increased or decreased compared to the control group, and the X-axis lists the genes. The bars are colored by whatever control the mouse was and whether it was wild type or not. Wild type, regular diet is gray; Wild type, high-fat diet is black; Knockout, regular diet is light blue; and Knockout, high-fat diet is red. Each bar represents the average gene expression change for that group, with small vertical lines showing the variation between samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "ii. The authors included this figure to show how blocking the Smad3 gene changes immune and inflammatory responses in fat cells. They wanted to know if the Smad3 knockout cells would make liver tissue less inflamed under a high-fat diet and looked at genes that show up when an immune response is needed. This figure helps demonstrate that the knockout mice express these protective genes more strongly than the wild type mice.\n",
    "\n",
    "iii. From this figure we can conclude that knockout mice have higher expression of anti-inflammatory and M2 macrophage marker genes. When fed a high-fat diet, genes like Mgl1, Mgl2, Mrc2, and Arg1 are much more active in the knockout, high-fat diet group compared to Wild type, high-fat diet mice, while Chi3l3 and Il10 show smaller differences. This means that the absence of Smad3 gives rise to immune genes that seem more protective.\n",

    "\n",
    "i. This figure was generated by measuring oxygen consumption rate over time in two groups of cells. The control is the black line, and this one has the Smad3 gene expressed. The red line called ShSmad3 has the Smad3 gene silenced. The X-axis shows time in minutes, and the Y-axis shows oxygen consumption rate, which reflects how much cells are using oxygen. Each point on the graph represents the average oxygen consumption rate measured at that time point for each cell in the designated control.\n",
    "\n",
    "ii. This experiment helps show how the Smad3 gene affects energy metabolism in cells. Measuring oxygen consumption rate allows scientists to see how much energy the cells produce and how efficiently they burn oxygen. The red line represents cells where Smad3 was blocked, while the black line shows normal control cells. By comparing both lines, researchers can see whether the loss of Smad3 changes how much energy the cells make.\n",
    "\n",
    "iii. The authors included this figure to show that blocking Smad3 increases energy production. It supports their overall hypothesis that Smad3 limits metabolic activity and that removing or silencing it allows cells to become more energetically and metabolically active. When norepinephrine is added, the ShSmad3 cells show a strong increase in oxygen consumption rate, while control cells have less response. This demonstrates that cells lacking Smad3 have higher oxygen consumption and stronger activation of metabolism, which connects directly to the idea that Smad3 suppresses fat burning and mitochondrial function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Additonal Figures**: An additional figure I would make is a comparison between mitochondrial activity and how much fat the cells store when the Smad3 gene is blocked. The figure would have two parts. The first part would be a bar graph showing the average mitochondrial activity in the control cells that have the gene expressed, versus the Smad3 knockdown cells that have the gene silenced. The X-axis would have the two groups: control and ShSmad3 which is the silenced gene. The Y-axis would show the mitochondrial activity. I would expect the ShSmad3 bar to be higher since blocking Smad3 makes the cells burn more energy. The second part would be an image showing the cells under a microscope stained with red dye that marks fat droplets. The control cells would have more red spots, showing fat stored, while the ShSmad3 cells would have fewer and smaller spots. This figure would help connect the energy measurements to the physical change in the cells, showing that when Smad3 is turned off, the cells become more metabolically active and store less fat.\n",

    "### 2.2 Summary of what I improved from my previous submission\n",
    "\n",
    "From my earlier project version, one big issue I had was confusing observations and features. Before, I wasn’t very clear about what counted as a mouse compared to what counted as a gene measurement. In this version I made sure to state that each row in the data set is a single gene (ENSMUSG IDs) and each column after the \"Gene\" column is one mouse sample (GSM IDs), with expression values as the features for each gene. I also rewrote my figure descriptions to be more organized, first explaining what is on each axis and then what each group or line means, and finally what conclusion the authors want to show with the figure. Overall, I tried to make my explanations less confusing and more directly connected to the research questions about Smad3, high-fat diet, and hepatic steatosis."
